# Experimental Study of Human Interaction

### Course Overview
A deep understanding of any social species requires understanding why and how brains interact. Paradoxically, social neuroscience has focused nearly exclusively on mapping the brain as if it evolved in isolation. This focus on the individual brain is understandable as serious methodological constraints have traditionally limited multi-brain, interactive paradigms. Making headway on how brains interact, however, is becoming increasingly tractable. This course highlights scientific and technological innovations advancing our understanding of how human minds meet during social interaction. Conceptual and methodological challenges of studying human interaction are dealt with in-class discussions, laboratories, and small group research projects on selected topics.

### Course Goal and Objectives
Insight into how human brains work in their most ubiquitous and biologically meaningful context, social interaction, has remained largely elusive, hence representing the “dark matter” of social neuroscience. This course ventures into this largely unexplored territory, pursuing the question of what constitutes a meeting of minds. Students will be expected to design, run, analyze, and write up an experiment answering a question of their choosing. Example research projects include but are not limited to studies of human interactive behavior in the real-world, the lab, simulated scenarios, or on social media.
